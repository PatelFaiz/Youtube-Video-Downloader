# Youtube-Video-Downloader
If you are using source code directly you need to install all modules in your interpreter and you have to store .ico file and .png file in same folder where you will run your code(or in your working directory).
Installing modules through command prompt : pip install module_name.
Installing in Pycharm : File > Settings > Project: _name_ > Python Interpreter, select your python interpreter and click on plus (+) icon there, after that search that module name for exmaple: pytube3, pytube4(whaterver the latest virsion) and click on install.
If you are using .exe file directly : First install and then all files will get extracted in a new folder viz. TubeLoader then open another .exe file into it and paste the link.
Note : In this verion we have given only one option to download files. There is no opation to select quality of the video you are downloading. Currently we are working on that.
